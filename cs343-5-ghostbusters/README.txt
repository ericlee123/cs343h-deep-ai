For this assignment, we mainly implemented algorithms that can be used for
infering the location of the ghosts in the pacman environment. It required
knowledge of bayes inference and particle filtering that were discussed in
class and were also covered in the book.

Majority of the time went in trying to make sense of the code base.
Understanding the data structures used and methods implemented for our use took
a long time.
