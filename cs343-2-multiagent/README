DESCRIPTION:
This assignment can be viewed in two parts: an evaluation function and minimax.
We began with a simple evaluation function that would incentivize Pacman to
perform actions to maximize his score, actions like eating food and avoiding
ghosts. To make our function better for question 5, we also considered whether
or not the ghosts were scared and if Pacman was within range of the scared
ghosts.
For the minimax part, we began with a vanilla implementation of minimax with one
maximizer and n minimizers. For alpha-beta pruning, we copied over the same
algorithm and recursively passed around alpha and beta values, so nodes would
know when to stop recursively calling their children. For expectimax, we made a
small modification where minimizers returned the average of their evaluated
children instead of the minimum.
