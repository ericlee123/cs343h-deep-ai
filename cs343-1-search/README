DESCRIPTION:
Each of the different search algorithms were straight-forward to implement and
test. The challenging part was to come up with the heuristics for the "Corners
Problem" and "Food Search Problem". For the heuristic for the "Corners
Problem", we simplify it to a problem without walls, which would underestimate
the cost in the original problem. So we came up with an algorithm that returned
the actual cost in the simplified problem, and used that as a heuristic. For the
heursitic for the "Food Search Problem", we simplify it to a problem with only
2 food pellets and without walls. So we look at the manhattan distance to
collect each pair of food pellets, and return the maximum of that as the
heursitic. This also underestimates the actual cost of the original problem.
