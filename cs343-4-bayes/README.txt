We mainly implemented algorithms from the book. There was nothing novel about
our work. Everything we coded up was from class or the book. There were a few
edge cases we had to deal with, like counting unconditioned variables with
respect to eliminating said variables. There was also one for normalizing,
according to Guneet. We also had to think about the value of information, or
VPI.
