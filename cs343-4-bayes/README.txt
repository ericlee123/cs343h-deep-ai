For this assignment, we mainly implemented algorithms that were discussed in
class, that were also given in the book. Majority of the time went in
understanding the data structures used. Actually impplementing the algorithms
was straightforward and easy after that.

There were a few edge cases we had to deal with. In the normalize method,
unconditioned variables with a single entry in the domain were changed to
conditioned variables. In the variableElimination method, we had to count the
number of unconditioned variables with respect to eliminating said variables.
